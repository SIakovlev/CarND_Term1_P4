You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first section called "Camera calibration" of the IPython notebook `lane_finding.ipynb`.  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function from OpenCV library.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

Here is an example of image distortion correction for one of the test images:

![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

The main routines are in the "Image processing pipeline" sectin of `lane_finding.ipynb` file.

Image thresholding is the logical disjunction (pythonic `|`) of the following:

* Yellow color thresholding (`yellow_select(...)` function in the code):
    * Convert image to HLS color space.
    * Determine the range of H, L, and S components for yellow color: **H: 15 - 55, L: 120 - 200, S: 120 - 255.** 
    * Threshold image based on these values 
* White color thresholding (`white_select(...)` function in the code):
    * Convert image to HLS color space.
    * Determine the range of H, L, and S components for white color: **H: 0 - 360, L: 210 - 255, S: 0 - 255.** 
    * Threshold image based on these values
* Sobel gradient thresholding for x coordinate (`sobel_abs(...)` function in the code).

Here's an example of the sequential application of methods above:

![alt text][image3]

The original undistorted picture is on the left, next we see the result of application of `yellow_select(...)` only, then we add white color thresholding and picture on the right is the result of all thresholding methods combined together (via logical "or"). 

The example for another image is given below. Note that the gradient thresholding helps when the lines are in the shadow:

![alt text][image4]

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform is in the function called `perspective(img, mode='f', scr=src, dst=dst):`. This function takes `img` as an input and, based on `mode`, returns inverse or forward perspective transform of this image. The source(`src`) and destination(`dst`) points were chosen in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32([[0, img_size[1]], 
                  [575, 450],
                  [705, 450],
                  [img_size[0], img_size[1]]])
dst = np.float32([[100, img_size[1]],
                  [100, 0],
                  [img_size[0]-100, 0], 
                  [img_size[0]-100, img_size[1]]])
```
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source (x, y)       | Destination (x, y)  | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| (0, 720)      | (100, 720)    | 
| (575, 450)    | (100, 0)      |
| (705, 450)    | (1180, 0)     |
| (1280, 720)   | (1180, 720)   |

Then the function calculates transform matrix and applies it to the image using OpenCV routines `getPerspectiveTransform` and `cv2.warpPerspective`:

```python
def perspective(img, mode='f', scr=src, dst=dst):
    
    img_size = (img.shape[1], img.shape[0])
   
    if mode == 'f':
        M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)
    elif mode == 'inv':
        M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(dst, src)
        
    return cv2.warpPerspective(img, M, img_size, flags=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
```

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image. Here is an example for straight lines:

This example shows the perspective transform for curved lines:

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

The line fitting algortihm combines convolution method and method of histogramms described in the lessons, and based on 3 key steps:

* At the start the algorithm calculates convolution of the **50px window** with the bottom half of the image. It allows to calculate positions for regions of interest (RoI) for left and right lines. Here is how I do it for the left line:
```python
   # Sum quarter bottom of image to get slice
   l_sum = np.sum(image[int(img_y/2):,:center], axis=0)
   conv_l = np.convolve(w, l_sum, 'same')
   leftx_base = np.argmax(conv_l)
```

* Then it goes through the image, slice by slice ( 1 slice correspond to 1/9 of the image height ) and gather all the points that lie inside RoI. The position of the next region of iterest is calculated from the maximum of the convolution of the current region of interest. I am also filtering this parameter in order to increase robustness with respect to outliers - it helps to avoid situations when the position of the next RoI is shifted too much, that is not realistic for the monotone lane line. Here is the code, showing this idea (`alpha` - parameter of the filter):
```python
   img_layer = image[win_y_low:win_y_high, win_xleft_low:win_xleft_high]
   img_layer_hist = np.sum(img_layer, axis=0)
   conv_left = np.convolve(w, img_layer_hist, 'same')
   mean = np.argmax(conv_left) + win_xleft_low
   leftx_current = np.int(alpha*mean + (1-alpha)*leftx_current)
```

* Finally the algorithm fits second order polynomes to the data. In order to increase robustness I have added filtering to the identified coefficients that depend on the brightness of the current frame by the following formula:
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%24%5Cbeta%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B0.3%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1&plus;0.3*%28b-90%29%5E2%7D%7D%24%24)

In the formula above, b stands for brightness and numeric values are adjusted so that it gives reasonably small beta for very bright images. The graph for different values of brightness is given below:
![alt text][image7]

This results to higher robustness with respect to a very bright part of the lane. Note, that the brightness needs to be measured for the lane image after perspective transformation, i.e:
```python
   b = np.mean(rgb2hsv(perspective(img), ch=2))
   beta = 0.3/np.sqrt(1+0.3*(b-90)**2)
```
Here is the code, with filtering implemented:
```python
   left_fit = betha*np.polyfit(lefty, leftx, 2) + (1-betha)*left_fit
   right_fit = betha*np.polyfit(righty, rightx, 2) + (1-betha)*right_fit
```

The procedure above gives the following resulting fit:

![alt text][image8]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

The procedure of curvature calculation is in lines 121-136 of `detect_lines_v2()` function (see `lane_finding.ipynb`).

The goal is to calculate curvature of the line based on coefficients identified after least squares polinomial fit. However in order to give the answer in sensible measurement units we need to convert pixel values to meters. To find y-axis coefficient, I approximately measured the distance between two vertical lines (in perspective view) in pixels and given that the lane width is about 3.7 meters, the `ym_per_pix` value is about 3.7/750. The value for `xm_per_pix` can be identified similarly, given that the length of the dashed line is about 3 meters: we project the lane with very distinguishable dashed lines and count how many of them can fit into 720 pixels. I got about 8, so the coefficient is 24/720.

```python
# Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
ym_per_pix = 24/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension
xm_per_pix = 3.7/750 # meters per pixel in x dimension
```

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
